<p>Cyber Inc. is a small company comprising of technology loving geeks. We have one common goal at Cyber Inc. and that is to make apps that our school will use in a long term. We have done quite a few projects and to know about them just head down to the projects page. Here below is a piece of code in xCode Objective C that will make a NSLog show Cyber Inc.</p>

<pre><code>NSLog("Cyber Inc");
</code></pre>

<p>We've made a web engine called SST Mosaic which we completed in about 3-4 months prior to the date of the starting of the project. So what SST Mosaic does is it renders images of the graduating batch of Secondary 4 students in School of Science and Technology, Singapore and make into an iconic image of the school such as the logo or the overview of the school. One upcoming project for us is the SST Open House 2014 app and possibly SST Moments.</p>
